## Theme toggle

Different ways to switch theme with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- Example-1: using dark-theme and light-theme classes (this one simulates Google Fonts old switch)
- Example-2: using root variables and dark-mode class
- Example-3: using root variables and [data-theme] attribute
- Example-4: using multiple themes with root and ids
